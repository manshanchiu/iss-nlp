They banned me because I demanded urgent help on my support ticket since it was related to my account security. They decided to ban me so they can keep their dignity. They always say that they are doing it for the clients, but the moment someone speaks up they ban him so they can keep everything perfectly looking for the next victim. I managed to get into my account and I withdrew everything. I am not saying they are scammers, but they for sure don't know how to handle clients.\""
